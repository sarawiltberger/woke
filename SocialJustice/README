Currently, we run Glassfish as a local server and our project accesses a 
database that is saved in a digital ocean droplet. There is a lot of garbage testing data in the 
database that we will get rid of later. To our knowledge everything works; however, the follow/support
buttons are inefficient and could be handled better.
We went to also host the entire project on digital ocean but were unable to figure that out and could use
some help with that if you know how to

Sincerely,
cs201ballers (aka Team 14)
